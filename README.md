The purpose of this project is to take a coin operated game such as UNIS's Rollin' On 24's, and modify it so that the guest no longer has to reach up to the top of the game where the coin mech is to play the game. The guest will be able to play the game from a button on the game, so that shorter guests can comfortably play the game.

If the game to modified is in an establishment that no longer uses tokens, the machine may be modified already to use a coin dispenser system, such as Speedy's One Stop Shop's Coin Hopper Mounting System (see ref 1). This system includes everything that one would need to make a coin operated game able to use a card system. The brains behind this system is a hopper control board that dispences the coin to the guest when it receives a credit-in signal. In the case of Speedy's control board, the credit input line is red. This line and any one of the six ground lines is the focus of this project.

The Items needed for this project are:
Arduino (code provided)
2 channel relay board
